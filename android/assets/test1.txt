The quaking army dawned on him, alone among corpses, buried to the brim. 

His presence here seemed without reason, the world around drenched in a bloody season, his enemies came with merciless eyes, his courage by now seemed to weazen.
He could play dead, let them pass by.  There shouldn’t be much that could force him to try. 

Yet he crawled above those corpses sodden, in the shadow of arrows he felt his resolve embolden.  He knew his death had long since effected, though he was still standing, miraculously resurrected.
His heart was fuzzy for the memories unfound, he took his steps to be battle bound, as if his strength could down the millions vanward, he still moved on with a mind unsound.

He would break, he would die, his demise was well nigh, of one thing he was far sure about, he would still not recede from the battle fought.
