The persistent voice had nudged his soul, collected the remnants and pieced him whole. A power spread light into his darkening vision, healing his wounds, surpassing mortal bounds, the divine presence aided his transition.  

He was left standing again, ‘fight’, he heard the voice say through his receding pain. Questions immobilized him; the why and the how paralyzed him. Who was it, he wanted to ask, who was it that put him up for the task?

The battlefield was merciless, it cared nought for his distress. He died again in moments after, he was reborn afresh, with new virgin flesh; it was as if fate made him a joke for laughter.

He realized his queries would not be sated, the world around him hardly waited. The pain of one death was torturous enough, without reliving it in cycle, thanks to a nameless seraph.

He fought and died in succession, the agony of death in endless rotation, yet the will he possessed hardly wavered, he fought on, learning with each defeat, evolving amidst the fear of being skewered.
