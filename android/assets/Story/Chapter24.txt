‘Why still fight?’ The voice once asked. ’ Why carry on with your broken might? Was a fascination worth the price of your salvation? Give up now, forget your vow, embrace your death, and rest your breath.’

Her voice was angelic, with a tone grave prophetic, but the annoyance still lingered, for his failure she hungered. He could sense that much, despite her granted crutch.

He asked her back, if he was so slack then why did she aid, why not just leave him with his enemies, to be mercilessly flayed?

‘The Gods above are rarely that prudent; to move in reason, have sense in decision, the mortals live for their amusement.’ She explained in a voice serene, sprouting from his very core, where as though it had always been. ‘Still I have the vim, to follow my whim. What drives your will to cross such a hurdle? You bear the whim of Gods and the strength of a mortal.’

So she lent him strength to humour herself, care not for the world that the evil engulf.  Then again, how more had he cared these lands for, all he had fought, a plain liking had bought. He threw away his meagre life, pushed his neck under enemy’s knife. Within he knew what waited was death, which the angel inside refused to bequeath. 

He stood up again, he knew not why, the girl of his heart kept forcing his try. She sparked in him that which never sparkled, unable to give up till his bleak blood curdled. Wonder it was, how a dame changes cause, for her wars ignite or a mere man’s might.
