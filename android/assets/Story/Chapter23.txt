He could see from afar how they fought, steadfast against the enemies war bought. Ages of training, efforts sweat draining, bearing its fruit, as the warriors fought with a sense astute.  The Princess fought among them with courage, her unshakeable spirit glowing through the carnage. The overwhelming battle still raged on, it was clear they won’t give up until the last of them wasn’t gone.

And here he was aided with divine intervention, the luxuries of invincibility, wasted on his capability, as every time he stood to fight, he was driven into submission. 

He stood up still in a monotonous drill, the oath for strength still holding his heart. All he knew was this is where he needs to start. But the hopelessness was seeping inside; his pace of change was hardly the required stride. 

The enemies came in hordes and swarms, the kingdom itself left lacking arms. The blessing he was given, made his weak heart riven, as the people around fell from the mighty force, the fault of his flaws made the boon a curse. 

Forced to watch in helplessness, as a realm crumbled in hopelessness, surrounded by death everywhere he went, the moans of people left its rotten scent.

The desolate man of weakened will , among the misery he fought still.
