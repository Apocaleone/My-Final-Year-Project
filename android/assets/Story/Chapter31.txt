The pain was unbearable, his deaths were horrible, yet he refused to give up, following this crucible. The answer was simple, choose with death to mingle. His rebirth was driven by his own choice, even though empowered by the heavenly voice.

The princess had long since been lost to his sight, in a sanctuary protected, preserving her light. She among the few, who stood their ground, survived the hordes that in numbers drowned. The ones that conquered those, that took him deaths to dispose, without any guardian, on their own feet they rose.

Desperation nagged his torn insides, why such weakness in him resides?  Even after so many tries, he was too weak to dilute the cries. The citizens moaned, for help they groaned but none were saved, his efforts were staved. Only he survived, while the armies thrived. Why was he so inept? In anguish he wept.

The guilt of it all, made him despair. How much would he fall, till the fight becomes fair?
