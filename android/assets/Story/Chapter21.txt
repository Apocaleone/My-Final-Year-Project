The day came when war broke out in earnest; strength of the week was sorely tested, while the strong wanted nothing more than to see the other bested. The hype went down as numbers grew, more monsters flooded the more they slew. Dread began to creep in those hearts, which before were counting yards.  Courage they had to keep fighting, he ran through the frenzy for her sighting.

There she was, showing strength, fighting alone or beside her friends. He realized that day what it means to hold power, why the noble, the wicked all wanted its bower. Some wanted to protect, some wanted respect while subduction of others a few expect. It was a universal answer, a key that had always eluded in its meaning for him. Yes he wanted power now, too late he realized, yet he took his vow, next time in her presence he would have her acceptance. He never looked for scuffle before, a sated gut; a peaceful life was all he adored. 
 
He knew she was strong to hold herself together, but should time reveal, should frail she feel, he wants to be there and be her tether. He wanted to be tough, to grant those he loved, protection enough. Was he so naive to approach his demise over some obsession? Granted it was for a woman, it was still hardly enough reason.

As he stepped into the cruel battle field, the naive warrior felt his frail will yield. Death found him fast; the world had ample mercy to kill him in haste.

Yet here he was, still fighting this senseless war. What happened after, that bought him this far?
